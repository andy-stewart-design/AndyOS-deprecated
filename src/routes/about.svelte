				Design works on the mind through the eyes. In the right context, with the right tone of
				voice, design has the ability to spark emotion, engage the imagination and even, at its
				best, inspire action.

				I'm Andy, a designer working at the intersection of brand and technology. I'm currently the
				Digital Creative Director at Turnstyle, a small creative studio on the north side of
				Seattle, where I help bring life to brands through strategic, thoughtful design.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a generalist both in training and disposition, my approach combines the craftsmanship of
				traditional graphic design practices with the dynamism of modern digital media. I have
				nearly a decade of experience in helping to realize even the most vague of ideas across a
				variety of touchpoints, from brand identities to digital experiences. My work is defined by
				my love for aesthetics, intuitive experiences, and solving challenging business problems.
