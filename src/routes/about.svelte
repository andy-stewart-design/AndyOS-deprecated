			Refined strategy meets spotless design meets powerful engineering, the perfect combo for a

			Design works on the mind through the eyes. In the right context, with the right tone of voice,
			design has the ability to spark emotion, engage the imagination and even, at its best, inspire
			action.

			I'm Andy, a designer working at the intersection of brand and technology. I'm currently the
			Digital Creative Director at Turnstyle, a small creative studio on the north side of Seattle,
			where I help bring life to brands through strategic, thoughtful design.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a generalist both in training and disposition, my approach combines the craftsmanship of
			traditional graphic design practices with the dynamism of modern digital media. I have nearly
			a decade of experience in helping to realize even the most vague of ideas across a variety of
			touchpoints, from brand identities to digital experiences. My work is defined by my love for
			aesthetics, intuitive experiences, and solving challenging business problems.
